# facial-emotion-recognition-with-HOG-neural-networks
This project aims to recognize facial emotions using machine learning techniques. The input images are preprocessed using Histogram of Gradients (HoG) feature extraction technique to extract facial features. The extracted features are then fed into a neural network for classification of facial emotions.
