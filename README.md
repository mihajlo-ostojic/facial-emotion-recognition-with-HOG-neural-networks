# Facial emotion recognition with histogram of oriented gradients and neural networks
This project aims to recognize facial emotions using machine learning techniques. The input images are preprocessed using Histogram of Gradients (HoG) feature extraction technique to extract facial features. The extracted features are then fed into a neural network for classification of facial emotions.


The project utilizes OpenCV library for image processing and analysis, along with machine learning models implemented through Keras, Scikit-Learn, and DLIB libraries. The project is developed using the Python programming language.


NOTE:This project is developed while studing computer vision at university, as an exercise, dataset of pictures is given at course but
i am not aware where did it came from so i will not post it with the project. I only left annotatios, to show how they look like.

Images are removed from dataset folder.
Dataset 68 facial landmarks is also used for recognising human face.

Model training can be started by running main.py file. Model evaluation can be started by running evaluate.py
